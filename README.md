# JobBoard Data Web Scraping and Automation

In this project Firstly we scrapped the data from the Indian Institute of Business and then through we scrapped the different different website of the job portal and the fetch different categories of the vacancies through like naukri.com and etc. We uses the modules like:
* ``WebDriver``: drives a browser natively, as a user would, either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium server, marks a leap forward in terms of browser automation.

* `Selenium WebDriver`: refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code. This is commonly referred to as just WebDriver.

* `Beautiful Soup`: is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

* `Pandas`: is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. Used for dataframe manupulations.
